# Instagram Login Cookie Project

## Project Focus
- Direct HTTP requests to Instagram login endpoints
- Extract and manage authentication cookies
- No browser automation (Selenium, Playwright, etc.)
- Python-based implementation

## Code Style
- Use `requests` library for HTTP operations
- Implement proper session management
- Handle CSRF tokens and form data correctly
- Include error handling for network requests
- Use type hints where appropriate

## Key Requirements
- Parse Instagram login forms and CSRF tokens
- Handle redirects and cookie persistence
- Extract session cookies for reuse
- Avoid user-agent detection issues
- Minimal dependencies

## File Structure
- Keep implementation focused and lightweight
- Separate concerns: login logic, cookie management, HTTP handling
- Include proper documentation for API usage
